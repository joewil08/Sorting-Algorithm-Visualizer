# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
This web application allows users to visualize the process of sorting an array with six different sorting algorithms. The user can customize and generate an array, select a sorting algorithm, and observe an animated visualization of how the array gets sorted. The application also displays key information such as time and space complexity for each algorithm and provides the option to enable/disable audio during the sorting process.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8iQWidZhk8) is a video demonstration!

## Features
- **Array Generation**: Users can generate arrays of various types (e.g., random, descending, nearly sorted, few uniques) and sizes (up to 250 elements).
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from six different sorting algorithms to visualize:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- **Algorithm Information**: Displays time/space complexities and properties for each algorithm.
- **Audio Toggle**: Enable or disable audio during the sorting process.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and algorithm implementation.
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the visualizer.

## How to Use
1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Select the array type from the dropdown and specify the array size (max of 250).
3. Click the "New" button to generate the array.
4. Choose one of the six sorting algorithms from the dropdown.
5. (Optional) Toggle audio using the checkbox.
6. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
7. Watch the animation and view the algorithm's information.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joewil08/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file using a live server. ([Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is a live server extension for Visual Studio Code)

## Future Enhancements
- Add more sorting algorithms.
- Add more visual customization options.
- Add step-by-step and speed control for the sorting process.
